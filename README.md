# Gas67-Magnetic-Case
Files pertaining to creating a Gas67 case for mainly 3d printing. This is a magnet-held case, with the gasket mount from the original Gas67 preserved.
Plate is not included, but might be added in a later update since I might want to make a new plate for this.
Skeletonized case will be available in a bit also.

**Components needed:**
- 4mm (diameter) 2mm (depth) neodymium magnet. **(8x)**

Free to use. Can be used for commercial uses, I don't care.

.STEP files provided if you want to modify the case for a screw-full design.

Made in F360, might be diagnostically useful in case you encounter a problem.

Any problems or questions, please contact Leliel#5659 on Discord. AMA! I can provide you with any project files given that you're willing to wait sometimes.
