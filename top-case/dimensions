Since I hate when people don't put dimensions (more of a pet peeve rather than anything) for their prints.

The outer width is 328mm (32.8cm), height is 126.223mm (12.6223cm), depth is around 7.494mm (0.7494cm). 
Please check if your desired printer has the bed size to support this, or you can manually split the components to fit into your printer.
