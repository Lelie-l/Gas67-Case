# Gas67-Magnetic-Case
Files pertaining to creating a Gas67 case for mainly 3d printing. This is a magnet-held case, with the gasket mount from the original Gas67 preserved.
Plate is not included, but might be added in a later update since I might want to make a new case for this.
Skeletonized case will be available in a bit also.

Free to use. Can be used for commercial uses, I don't care.
